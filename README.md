# Galvanize-DSI-Capstone-Project-3

### Proposal 1

**Huge Stock Market Dataset**

https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs

Plan:
1, Build a LSTM model to predict next day price of a stock.
2, Develop a web application using Flask that deploy the LSTM model.
3, Buy/sell stocks according to the suggestion by LSTM model, and record the transaction in an SQL database.

Please note, this is just a simulation to help understand the whole workflow. Will not incorporate real-time stock price information. Maybe it's too much for a one-week project? Do I have enough time to complete???

### Proposal 2

**Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction**

This is a Kaggle competetion. It helps study the Mechanism of Action (MoA) of a drug. The task is to develop an algorithm that automatically classifies a drug into multi-label MoA classes.

I plan to build varies Neural Network models, and compare their performance. If I have enough time, I will also try models other than Neural Network. My previous two capstone projects are all related to healthcare problem. So this one may be a good choice for me too. I intend to find jobs in healthcare field in the future because my previous career was related to biomedical research. 

### Proposal 3

Adience Benchmark Gender And Age Classification

This is a image classification project. It takes an face image and find out the person's sex and age. 

I also plan to build varies Neural Network models, and compare their performance. If I have enough time, I will also try models other than Neural Network. This one is good for demonstration. I can take pictures during the presentation and classify the sex and age.
